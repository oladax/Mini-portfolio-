      Hacking is my favorite tech field because I personally developed interest in it compared to other tech skills.<br />

<br /> If you have the right resources and time; just learn hacking and artificial intelligence. You wouldn’t be in the league of those desperately looking for an entry jobs in other fields because there are always millions of people in that field available and better than you. <br />

<br /> I’m not saying you don’t stand any chances in other field and again if you are a self taught, your chances are low  and weak unless you have everything in demand and more to append in order to stand a chance of getting a job.<br />

<br /> However, as a self taught, if you are conversant with hacking, you have good knowledge of networking, cryptography, hardwares, Linux, Ai and other hacking tools. <br />

<br /> You are just good.<br />

<br /> People wouldn’t care if you didn’t even graduate from a secondary school, as long you can retrieve their money for them, they will surly pay you based on agreement.<br />

If you have knowledge of bypassing financial app passwords and access the owner’s money, they will demand for your service.
Stuffs like that, accessing important informations (databases). That’s it.


<br /> But in other fields, who cares? You will even need to run a sponsorship ads before people develop interest in your application or website; that’s even when you are independent.
<br />

<br /> If you want avoid unnecessary headaches, rejections and frustrations as a tech enthusiast person.
<br />

<br /> Start learning hacking, bit by bit. Hack yourself, unlock your device without your passwords, do this to other devices you lay hands on ethically and keep going. <br />
<br />
It will speak for you. <br />
